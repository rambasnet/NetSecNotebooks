## Jupyter Notebook

-   Install Python 3.x Miniconda for Linux: https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
-   Once miniconda is installed, install Jupyter Notebook using conda

```bash
curl -o Miniconda.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda.sh # pick defaults; python 3 is installed!
conda update conda
conda install notebook # jupyter notebook
conda install -c conda-forge xeus-cling #c++ kernel
```

## Play with Notebooks

-   Clone/download this repository
-   You must run the notebook as root to use some scappy features such as sniff()
-   Using a terminal `cd` into the repo folder and run `jupyter notebook`

```bash
cd <NetworkSecurity_Repo>
jupyter notebook
```
    
-   Open 00-TableOfContents.ipynb chapter and access all the notebooks
