    "# Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "- computer networks are so ubiquitous that they're taken for granted\n",
    "- we're constantly connected to Internet and use applications that rely on networking\n",
    "    - email, social media, the Web\n",
    "- these applications rely on a particular network protocol, but each protocol uses the same general network transport methods\n",
    "- there are vulnerabilities in the networking protocols themselves and on systems and applications running on the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Components\n",
    "- Routers, Switches, Hubs\n",
    "- Firewalls, Gateway, Modem, Proxy\n",
    "- Network Cables (Cat5, Fiber Optic, etc.)\n",
    "- Host/System (Desktop, Laptops, Smart phones and Servers)\n",
    "    - Ineteret of Things (IOT) devices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- most commonly used ones based on size of network\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**\n",
    "    1. Personal Area Network (PAN)\n",
    "        - small networks with few hosts, Wireless router, modem, etc. e.g. home networks, small business network\n",
    "    2. Wrieless Local Area Network (WLAN)\n",
    "        - small networks with WiFi connections\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. **Campus Area Network (CAN)**\n",
    "    - network spread over a campus like university, college or school system and district\n",
    "    - may have large number of multile WiFi repeaters, servers, routers and switches, firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**\n",
    "    - can span an entire geographic area (such as town, city or a region)\n",
    "    - networks may be managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), city government, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "5. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**\n",
    "    - loosely speaking, this is the Internet\n",
    "    - connects many MANs and other networks across a bigger physical area and distances\n",
    "    - managed by a vast number of stakeholders (government and industry) across the globe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OSI Model\n",
    "- Open Systems Interconnection model\n",
    "- governs the language used by systems in the network to talk to each other\n",
    "- the structure of the language is described in 7 layers by the OSI model\n",
    "- the conceptual layers make it easier for different network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) and applications (Web, email) to focus on their respective layers and ignore the others\n",
    "\n",
    "### OSI layers\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/OSIModel.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REMEMBER: PDNTSPA - Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical layer** \n",
    "    - lowest layer that deals with the physical connection between two points\n",
    "    - responsible for activating, maintaining, and deactivating these bit-stream communications\n",
    "    - Ethernet card and cable, WiFi Card belong to this layer\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Data-link layer**\n",
    "    - deals with transferring data providing high-level functions (error correction and flow control)\n",
    "    - provides procedures for activating, maintaining, and deactivating data-link connections\n",
    "    - ARP (Address Resoultion Protocol) is a common protocol that uses this layer\n",
    "    - Ehternet switches are network devices that use Layer 2 protocol\n",
    "    - local network devices use data-link layer to route traffic internally in the same network\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Network layer**\n",
    "    - works as the middle ground\n",
    "    - primarily role is to pass information between the lower and the higher layers\n",
    "    - provides addressing (IP) and routing between two different networks\n",
    "    - most routers and layer-3 switches are primarily use this layer\n",
    "    - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets also exist on this layer\n",
    "    - ICMP packets are used for messaging, diagnostics and connectivity\n",
    "    - ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply messages are used by **ping** utility\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Transport layer**\n",
    "    - provides transparent transfer of data between systems\n",
    "    - provides reliable data communication, so the higher layers do not have to worry about reliability or cost-effectiveness of data transmission\n",
    "    - TCP and UDP are commonly used protocols of this layer\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Session layer**\n",
    "    - responsible for establishing and maintaining connections between network applications\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Presentation layer**\n",
    "    - responsible for presenting the data to applications in a syntax or language they understand\n",
    "    - supports things like encryptiong, data compressions, image file (GIF, JPG) etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "7. **Application layer**\n",
    "    - the layer users interact with\n",
    "    - concerned with keeping track of the requirements of the application\n",
    "    - HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, Telnet are some protocols used in this layer\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Packet Encapsulation\n",
    "- starting from the application layer, the packet wraps the presentation layer around the data, which wraps the session layer, which wraps the transport layer, and so forth\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/PacketEncapsulation.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sockets\n",
    " - standard way to perform network communications through the OS\n",
    " - socket API takes care of OSI details\n",
    " - in C, sockets behave a lot like files where you use read() and write() to receive and send data\n",
    " - /usr/includesys/sockets.h provide a bunch of functions to work with sockets\n",
    " - socket(), connect(), bind(), listen(), accept(), send(), recv()\n",
    "\n",
    "![Server-Client](resources/ServerClientConnection.png)\n",
    " - we'll use **Scapy** python library to create packets with various protocol types and send across networks\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "## IP Address\n",
    "- numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network\n",
    "    - uses Internet Protocol (IP) for routing packets\n",
    "- two types: IPv4 and IPv6\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv4 (version 4)\n",
    "- uses 32-bit number to represent usually written in 4 quads of decimals : XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\n",
    "    - e.g. 192.168.1.1\n",
    "- most prevalent\n",
    "- can support upto $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$ unique addresses\n",
    "- each decimal number (8-bit value) that can range from 0-255\n",
    "![IP Header](resources/IP-Header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv6 (version 6)\n",
    "- uses 128-bit number and the scheme is not quite readable, e.g.: 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public addresses\n",
    "- used by public network and/or devices\n",
    "- routeable over the Internet, publicly accessible unless behind firewall\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private addresses\n",
    "- reserved for internal or private networks to communiate with each other\n",
    "- private IP addresses do not have to be unique across networks allowing for IPv4 addresses to not completely deplet\n",
    "- private networks use Network Address Translation (NAT) technique to connect private networks to the the Internet\n",
    "    - Edge router/gateway/proxy server usually does the NAT to route packets from systems in private network to the Internet and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "#### private addresses\n",

    "\n",
    "- most home routers use 16-bit block\n",
    "- mid-sized organization typically use 20-bit block\n",
    "- large institutions like Universities use 24-bit block\n",

    "## TCP 3-Way Handshake\n",
    "- the following figure depicts TCP packet header\n",
    "\n",
    "![TCP Header Format](resources/TCP-Header.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable packet delivery between hosts\n",
    "- uses flags, sequence and acknowledge numbers to guarantee the delivery of packets\n",
    "- checksum of every packet is sent as well to verify the integrity of the data\n",
    "- TCP 3-Way handshake must be completed to connect and establish a reliable connection\n",
    "\n",
    "![TCP Handshake](resources/TCPHandShake.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- only the first two packets of TCP connection have the SYN flag on\n",
    "    - first two packets are used to synchronize sequence numbers\n",
    "- ACK packets are sent back and forth to transmit the actual data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Media Access Control (MAC) Address\n",
    "- unique hardware address assigned to Network Interface Card (NIC)\n",
    "- exists within Data-link Layer and used by Ethernet, WiFi, and Blutooth devices to communiate\n",
