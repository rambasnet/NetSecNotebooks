      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient, provides a means\n",
      "       for configuring one or more network interfaces using the  Dynamic  Host\n",
      "       Configuration  Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by\n",
      "       statically assigning an address.\n",
      "\n",
      "OPERATION\n",
      "       The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central server which main‐\n",
      "       tains  a list of IP addresses which may be assigned on one or more sub‐\n",
      "       nets.  A DHCP client may request an address from this  pool,  and  then\n",
      "       use  it  on  a  temporary basis for communication on network.  The DHCP\n",
      "       protocol also provides a mechanism whereby a client can learn important\n",
      "       details about the network to which it is attached, such as the location\n",
      "       of a default router, the location of a name server, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "       There are two versions of the DHCP  protocol  DHCPv4  and  DHCPv6.   At\n",
      "       startup the client may be started for one or the other via the -4 or -6\n",
      "       options.\n",
      "\n",
      "       On startup, dhclient reads the dhclient.conf for configuration instruc‐\n",
      "       tions.  It then gets a list of all the network interfaces that are con‐\n",
      "       figured in the current system.  For each interface, it attempts to con‐\n",
      "       figure the interface using the DHCP protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "       In  order  to  keep  track  of  leases across system reboots and server\n",
      "       restarts, dhclient keeps a list of leases it has been assigned  in  the\n",
      "       dhclient.leases  file.   On  startup,  after  reading the dhclient.conf\n",
      "       file, dhclient reads the dhclient.leases file  to  refresh  its  memory\n",
      "       about what leases it has been assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "       When  a  new  lease  is  acquired,  it  is  appended  to the end of the\n",
      "       dhclient.leases file.  In order to prevent the file from becoming arbi‐\n",
      "       trarily large, from time to time dhclient creates a new dhclient.leases\n",
      "       file  from  its  in-core  lease  database.   The  old  version  of  the\n",
      "       dhclient.leases  file is retained under the name dhclient.leases~ until\n",
      "       the next time dhclient rewrites the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Old leases are kept around in case the DHCP server is unavailable  when\n",
      "       dhclient  is  first  invoked  (generally during the initial system boot\n",
      "       process).  In that event, old  leases  from  the  dhclient.leases  file\n",
      "       which have not yet expired are tested, and if they are determined to be\n",
      "       valid, they are used until either they expire or the  DHCP  server  be‐\n",
      "       comes available.\n",
      "\n",
      "       A  mobile host which may sometimes need to access a network on which no\n",
      "       DHCP server exists may be preloaded with a lease for a fixed address on\n",
      "       that  network.  When all attempts to contact a DHCP server have failed,\n",
      "       dhclient will try to validate the static lease,  and  if  it  succeeds,\n",
      "       will use that lease until it is restarted.\n",
      "\n",
      "       A  mobile  host  may  also travel to some networks on which DHCP is not\n",
      "       available but BOOTP is.  In that case, it may be  advantageous  to  ar‐\n",
